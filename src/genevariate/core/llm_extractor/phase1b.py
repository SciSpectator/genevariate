"""Phase 1b — per-GSE, per-label context inference agents.

Faithful reproduction of the ``GSEInferencer`` from the pre-DSPy
``llm_extractor.py`` (commit f99db77~1).  Three independent Ollama calls
(Tissue / Condition / Treatment) re-annotate samples whose Phase 1 output
is ``Not Specified`` using the enclosing GSE's title/summary/design as the
SYSTEM prompt — Ollama caches the system-prompt KV tensors across samples
within one GSE, giving the ~40% speed-up referenced in CLAUDE.md.

Public API:
    NS, is_ns
    _llm_call_think_off                      (low-level HTTP call)
    _parse_single_label                      (output parser)
    GSEInferencer(gse_id, gse_meta, ollama_url).infer_sample(gsm, raw, labels)
    Phase1bAgent().infer_sample(gsm, raw, labels, gse_ctx)
                                             (thin wrapper for pipeline use)

Prompts, retry semantics, max_tokens=60, think=False, keep_alive=-1 match
the original byte-for-byte — the only changes are (a) removing
watchdog/log hooks that aren't used in the offline pipeline, (b)
replacing ``requests.Session`` with stdlib ``urllib`` so this module has
the same zero-dep surface as ``phase1.py``.
