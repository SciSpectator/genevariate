"""Phase 2 runner — dictionary normalization over a phase-1 corpus.

    python3 run_phase2.py --corpus 'p1_*.json' --out-dir . --workers 256

PIPELINE
    1. build the dictionary of distinct label values (Tissue/Condition/Treatment)
    2. resolve what is decidable without a model (junk, exact vocabulary match)
    3. resolve short forms against the study that wrote them
    4. retrieve candidates and let the model select
    5. mint a local identifier for concepts no vocabulary covers
    6. apply the finished dictionary to every sample (pure lookup, instant)
    7. export one gzipped CSV per platform

Every distinct value is decided ONCE and applied everywhere it occurs, so the
corpus is internally consistent by construction. Nothing is carried between runs;
the dictionary is written alongside the corpus as the record of what was decided.
