"""Which metadata columns the extractor puts in front of the model.

A platform can be chosen freely, so the columns should be choosable too: GEO
records differ between an RNA-seq submission and an array one, and a column that
carries the interesting text on one platform is empty on another.

The default is deliberately frozen. It is the five-column set the published run
used, and reproducing the paper's numbers depends on it not moving. Anything
beyond that is opt-in, and the run manifest records what was chosen so a result
can always be traced back to the input it saw.

Column names are GEOmetadb's. Each maps to a prompt field name, because the
prompt artifacts were optimized against those names and renaming them would
silently change what the model reads.
