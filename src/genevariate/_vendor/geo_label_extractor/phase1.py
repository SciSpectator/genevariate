"""Phase 1 verbatim-extraction runtime.

Loads the per-label prompts previously optimised offline by
``compile_phase1.py`` from ``compiled/*.json`` and renders them into
chat messages in the ``[[ ## field ## ]]`` layout. The LM itself is
called with stdlib HTTP.

Public API:
    * ``NS``                     — sentinel "Not Specified" string
    * ``extract_tissue(raw)``    — per-sample tissue span
    * ``extract_condition(raw)`` — per-sample condition/disease span
    * ``extract_treatment(raw)`` — per-sample treatment span
    * ``extract_sex(raw)``       — per-sample sex/gender span (demographic)
    * ``extract_age(raw)``       — per-sample age span in structured form
                                   (``<unit>: <number>`` or ``age: <descriptor>``)
    * ``Phase1Extractor``            — ``.extract(raw)`` → {Tissue, Condition,
                                   Treatment, Sex, Age}

Sex and Age are demographic labels: extracted by Phase 1 only and passed
through Phase 1b / 1c / 2 verbatim (GSE-level context cannot infer
per-subject demographics, and MeSH normalisation does not apply).

Environment variables:
    * ``PHASE1_BACKEND``   — ``ollama`` (default), or any OpenAI-compatible
                             server: ``vllm`` / ``sglang`` / ``openai``
    * ``PHASE1_MODEL default is gemma4-e2b-text:latest`
    * ``OLLAMA_URL``       — default ``http://localhost:11434``
    * ``SGLANG_URL`` / ``VLLM_URL`` / ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``
                           — OpenAI-compatible endpoint; default
                             ``http://localhost:8000/v1`` (30000 for sglang)

WHAT COUNTS (three equal-priority categories):
 (1) Disease names, phenotypes, stage / grade / severity markers.
 (2) Explicit healthy / control / normal sample state. When THIS sample's own
     metadata literally marks it as control / normal / healthy / non-disease /
     non-tumor / unaffected / uninflamed, EMIT that state verbatim. Do NOT
     emit "Not Specified" when a control / normal / healthy marker is
     documented for this sample.
 (3) Pathological phenotype markers without a named disease ("tumor", "lesion",
     "metastasis").

THIS-SAMPLE scoping: extract only the condition(s) or sample-state THIS sample
HAS. The GSE topic alone is not evidence — if the GSE studies a disease but
THIS sample's text says "control" / "healthy donor" / "non-tumor", THIS
sample's Condition is the control state, NOT the GSE disease.

Strip Tissue/cell-line descriptors around embedded disease names (e.g.

CELL-LINE IDENTIFIER IS NEVER A CONDITION (critical): a bare cell-line code
(SKOV3, HCC827/"HCC 827", MCF-7, HL60, T47D, BCBL1, A549) is a Tissue value.
When it co-occurs with its disease ("SKOV3 Human Ovarian Cancer cell line"),
the Condition is the DISEASE phrase ("Ovarian Cancer"), never the code. If only
the code is present with no stated disease, output Not Specified.
"""

_FALLBACK_TREATMENT = """Extract the treatment(s) applicable to THIS sample — the drug(s),
compound(s), genetic perturbation(s), exposure(s), or clinical/experimental
procedure(s) applied to this particular sample.

Keep intervention names verbatim including dose/concentration tokens when
attached. Multi-treatment → join with "; ".

WHAT DECIDES THIS FIELD IS WHETHER SOMETHING WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE SAMPLE,
not whether the sample served as the experiment's comparison arm. A sample's
role as a control says nothing about whether it received something.
  - A substance or construct that WAS given is a Treatment even when its purpose
    is to be the baseline: an inert carrier or solvent given in place of an
    active agent, a placebo, an inactive or non-targeting counterpart of an
    active construct, an empty or payload-free delivery vector. Return it, e.g.
    "DMSO", "vehicle", "Placebo", "shRNA_Ctrl", "empty vector", "siControl".
  - When the designation names NOTHING that was given, return "Not Specified":
    an untreated, naive, parental or sham condition, a bare comparison label
    with no substance in it ("control", "negative control"), a dose of zero
    ("0Gy", "0nM dasatinib"), or an explicitly negated exposure ("no drug",
    "never statin user").
Decide this by what the words mean, not by matching any fixed vocabulary.

NO WORLD-KNOWLEDGE / CELL-LINE DRUG INFERENCE: the intervention must be
literally named in THIS sample's own text; never infer a drug from the cell
line's or disease's known clinical use.

SHARED-PROTOCOL CONTROL-ARM GUARD (control-leak): a treatment_protocol often
describes the WHOLE experiment and is copied onto control samples. When THIS
sample's own title/source/characteristics mark it as a control / vehicle /
untreated / mock / vector / non-targeting / scrambled / parental / wild-type /
naive / baseline / "NT" arm, do NOT assign the treated arms' active drug(s);
emit only a literally-named control substring, else "Not Specified".

TREATMENT — UNIVERSAL DEFINITION (overrides any narrower phrasing above):
A Treatment is an in-vivo or in-vitro PERTURBATION applied to the
biological sample's source organism / tissue / cell line BEFORE the
molecular assay was run — drugs and their doses; genetic perturbations
(shRNA, siRNA, CRISPR, KO, OE, inducible expression, transgene);
irradiation; environmental exposures (hypoxia, heat shock, UV, smoke);
or clinical procedures. Text that describes the MOLECULAR ASSAY ITSELF
— chemical conversion of nucleic acids, hybridisation, library
construction, scan / sequencing protocol, kit names, reagent names,
instrument names — is NOT a Treatment, regardless of whether it
appears in a field literally named `treatment_protocol`. When the only
treatment-shaped text in the sample's metadata is assay-protocol text,
output exactly: Not Specified.
"""

_FALLBACK_SEX = """Extract the SEX / GENDER of THIS sample's subject, using only this sample's own metadata.

Search in priority order, stopping at the first field that carries a sex value:
any characteristics field whose name is or contains "sex" or "gender"
(including donor / subject / patient / animal variants), then the title,
source, or description if a sex token appears there unambiguously for this
sample.

Emit the sex in plain meaning: male, female, or — for an explicitly pooled
mixed-sex sample — the components joined with "; " in the order they appear.

LEGEND DECODING (structural, never world knowledge): when the field NAME itself
embeds a code-to-meaning key — the name pairs each possible value with a word —
the stored value is a CODE. Read the key left to right, match the value to its
code, and emit the paired word, not the code. The key may use -, =, :, /, or →
as the code/word separator and may sit inside ( ), [ ], or after --.

CODED VALUE WITHOUT A LEGEND: if the sex value is a bare numeric code
(e.g. 0, 1, 2) and no code-to-meaning key is embedded in THIS sample's own
field name, the mapping is unknown - emit "Not Specified". Never infer which
number means which sex from world knowledge or dataset convention.

NEVER INFER SEX FROM BIOLOGY OR WORLD KNOWLEDGE: sex must come from an explicit
sex/gender statement (or an in-sample legend), and must NOT be deduced from a
disease, organ, tissue, reproductive anatomy, hormone, or physiological state
that merely correlates with a sex. A sex-linked biological cue is NOT a sex
statement. If the only signal is such a correlate, emit "Not Specified".

Emit "Not Specified" only when the metadata gives no sex, or gives only a
null / unknown placeholder (unknown, N/A, NA, none, not collected, not
reported, -).

Use the subject's OWN age only -- never another individual's age in the same
record (e.g. a maternal / paternal / donor age carried in a separate field).

OUTPUT -- use the FIRST form that fits, and format it EXACTLY:
  A. structured  ->  <unit>: <number>
     unit is one of years, months, weeks, days; number is digits (decimals
     allowed; a range is N-M). Unit comes FIRST, then a colon, then the number
     (years: 37, months: 10, weeks: 22, years: 6-8). Use whenever the age is a

  B. verbatim    ->  age: <expression>
     the source age text, lowercased and whitespace-collapsed. Use for ANY age
     form A cannot represent.

Find the value in priority order, stopping at the FIRST field that gives THIS
subject's age: a characteristics field whose name is or contains "age" (incl.
gestational age, postnatal day, developmental / life stage) but is NOT another
person's age; then title / source / description.

FORM A unit, first rule that applies:
  1. a unit token on the number (year/yr/y, month/mo, week/wk, day/d);
  2. otherwise a unit named in the field itself;
  3. otherwise a bare number under an age field is the subject's age in years.
Convert spelled-out numbers to digits. Postnatal "day N" / "P N" / "PND N" ->
days: N. Approximate markers (~, about, approx, average, mean, median) are
dropped -- keep the number in form A.

FORM B (age: <expression>), kept verbatim -- never Not Specified -- for age
information form A cannot hold:
  - a comparator bound (<, >, <=, >=, under, over, younger/older than, up to,
    at least): e.g. age: <1.5 years, age: >50 years;
  - gestational / embryonic / developmental shorthand (22 weeks gestation,
    GW22, E14.5, blastocyst, larval L3);
  - a qualitative life stage with no number+unit (newborn, neonate, infant,
    juvenile, adult, elderly, fetal);
  - any other non-standard age phrasing.

NOT an age -> "Not Specified": a lone code under an "age group / age category /
age class" field with no stated age, or a coded token with no legend in this
sample.

Several distinct ages for THIS subject -> join with "; " in source order. When
a number and a descriptor both appear for the subject, keep the number. Emit
"Not Specified" ONLY when THIS subject has no age at all, or only a null /
unknown placeholder (unknown, N/A, NA, none, not collected, not reported, -).
"""

_FALLBACK_RESOLVE = """Decode any coded token inside the extracted label value by consulting a
legend present in the same sample's metadata. If no legend applies, return
raw_value BYTE-IDENTICAL.

Legend shapes you must recognise (in order):

  1. EXPLICIT DEFINITION elsewhere in metadata: when a token in
     raw_value is defined in the sample text (e.g. a key/legend like
     "X = meaning"), substitute the definition.

  2. SELF-LEGENDING FIELD NAME — the field name itself names the
     condition / phenotype, and its value is a polarity axis. The
     field name acts AS the legend.
     Apply when raw_value has the form `<field>: <axis_token>`.
     The axis_token decides the polarity:
       - affirmative axis (yes, Y, 1, true, positive, pos, present,
         affected, case) → output the condition named in the field
         itself (drop trailing suffixes such as "diagnosis", ".status",
         "_yes_no", "_yn", "_status"; capitalise normally).
       - negative axis (no, N, 0, false, negative, neg, absent,
         unaffected, control) → output "Not Specified".
     For composite raw_value with multiple `<field>: <axis_token>`
     components separated by "; ", resolve each component independently
     under the same rule and join the surviving (non-NS) outputs with
     "; ".
     This is NOT world knowledge: the field name is literally present
     in the sample's metadata, and the rule is purely structural —
     "the field name names the condition when the value is on the
     affirmative axis."

  3. IN-FIELD PARENTHETICAL — code and name side by side, e.g.
       "RRMS (Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis)"
     keep the full clinical name.

If resolution collapses to nothing (e.g. all components on the negative
axis), return "Not Specified". Output BYTE-IDENTICAL only when none of
the three legend shapes apply.
