"""Phase 2: normalisation of Phase 1 labels against a controlled vocabulary.

This is the single driver for Phase 2. The domain logic lives unchanged in
phase2_mesh, phase2_llm, mesh_lookup, cellline_db, phase2_normalize and
phase2_curate; this file connects them and decides only what runs concurrently.

It replaces two partial drivers. One carried the study-context and warm-up
paths but never minted identifiers for values outside the vocabulary; the other
minted them but resolved every sample serially. Neither produced a complete
corpus on its own.

Resolution order is Phase2Mesh's, not this file's: episodic memory, the
Cellosaurus reference gate for Tissue, the cell-line identity gate, exact MeSH,
existing out-of-vocabulary entries, candidate retrieval with the picker, and
minting. Two tiers stay off by default because enabling them was measured to
damage the corpus: the polarity tier erased about 66,000 already extracted
values to Not Specified, and the picker with study context injected reread
sample-level values against study-level text. Both remain available through
PHASE2_USE_POLARITY and PHASE2_USE_PICKER.

Concurrency follows data dependence. Every distinct pair of raw value and
column is resolved once, and those resolutions are independent, so they run at
the full configured width. Consolidation of out-of-vocabulary values is
sequential within a connected component of the similarity graph, because a
later spelling must be able to join a concept an earlier one created, and
independent across components, because values in different components are
further apart than the merge threshold and can never be candidates for one
another.

Hardware is discovered, not assumed. Endpoints are probed at startup and work
is spread over whatever responds.

    The cascade mints out-of-vocabulary (OOV) concepts per surface form and

    same concept could therefore fragment across ids differing only in case,
    whitespace, or hyphenation (e.g. ``PBMC``/``pbmc``, ``wild type``/``wildtype``,
    ``Mock``/``mock``). This step folds every OOV/ART concept whose label is
    identical up to case, whitespace, hyphen, underscore, or dot onto a single
    canonical id + label (the most frequent surface form in the corpus), across
    both the top-level resolution and every per-study ``by_gse`` resolution.

    Deterministic, idempotent, and closed under the fold; touches ONLY OOV/ART
    assignments — MeSH descriptors and Cellosaurus identifiers are never changed.
    Runs in-memory on ``res`` before export, so every end-to-end pipeline run
