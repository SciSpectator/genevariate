GEO NS Repair  v2    GSE-Context-Aware Raw Extraction

Architecture
   Swarm of agents  one GSEWorker agent per GSE experiment
      Each agent handles its own GSE (full context, 3 tools),
      finishes, then the pool assigns it the next pending GSE.
      Agents run in parallel (N slots = VRAM / model size).
   Two-step LLM per NS field:
      1. Raw extraction   extract exactly what the text states, no renaming
      2. Phase 1.5 collapse via 4-tier Memory Agent (see below)

  Memory Agent  (biomedical_memory.db  shared across all platforms/runs)
  
    Tier 1  Core memory     top-50 labels injected into every prompt 
    Tier 2  Semantic memory ~3800 labels embedded, cosine RAG query  
    Tier 3  Episodic memory log of every past resolution + conf.     
    Tier 4  Knowledge graph synonym / variant triples (SQLite)       
  
  Phase 1.5 priority: Episodic  KG  Semantic+LLM  Deterministic rules

   GSEContext (MemGPT-style rolling memory)
       as each NS sample is resolved, the context is updated live
       subsequent samples in the same GSE see the newly assigned labels
   NEVER normalises biology  (HSV  HIV, ALS  AD, etc.)
